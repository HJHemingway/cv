    <h3>-earliest friends i remember are eric and brian in kindergarten
    </h3>
    <h3>I remember a kid who was tan and lived a few blocks up the street from us with fruit trees in his backyard. I remember watching anastasia at his house. The train scene with the goblins was rivetting. At point he cut his hand on something and I remember seeing his hand all blooded.I also remember watching The Fifth Element at his place.
    </h3>
    <h3>I remember being ahead of both my grade and the grade above me. I would finish before everyone. It was too easy for me. I also remember having quite a fight where i was on the other side of the table from her crying and very upset. like i was running away from her.</h3>
